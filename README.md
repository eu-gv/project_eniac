Evaluation of the strategic expansion of Eniac e-commerce in the Brazilian market over the intermediate company Magist.

The main idea was to estimate whether Magist could be used as an intermediate company to quickly access the e-commerce brazilian market, but still keeping Eniac's high-standard in terms of customers satisfaction ane reliable deliveries. Thus, Magist would need to provide its services for all the steps of the supply chain and for Eniac's lack of knowledge of the brazilian market.

The main two concerns were about Magist being a good partner for high-end tech products and fast deliveries.
The analysis of the dataset provided by Magist for a period over 20 months raised many doubts about signing a 3-year deal with Magist (as shown in the presentation). That brought to the conclusion of not recommending Magist for our expansion in Brazil, but evaluate other possible companies.
